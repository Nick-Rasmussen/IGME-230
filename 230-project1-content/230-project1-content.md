## Game Concept:

Take control of a rocketship and get it to orbit. On the way, you'll encounter a number of obstacles <br />

ranging from birds to space debris. The higher you get, the more they grow in size and numbers. <br />

## Story:

Look alive, pilot, launch was T-10 seconds ago and there's no turning back. But wait a minute, <br />

who put all those birds and planes in the way?!? Better buckle up and put on your helmet. <br />

Your crew is depending on you for a smooth ride into space, and that doesn't include blowing up the ship.




## Esthetics:

* ### Graphics
	
	*Pixellated and cartoonish. Simplistic graphics and over-the-top animations make the game feel light hearted

* ### Music
	
	* 8-bit track to fit the visuals. Possible two seperate tracks for gameplay and menus/score review screens

* ### Sound Effects
	
	* Match the animations in over-the-top style. Up to 2 sounds per object, one for a close call and one for a hit.
	
	* Additional sounds include initial rocket ignition (start of game) and getting to orbit (win condition), as well as explosions on collision with the rocket (lose condition).<br />

## Gameplay:

* ### Mechanics
	
	* Simple, avoidance-based gameplay mechanics
	
	* Obstacles get bigger and more numerous as game advances to increase difficulty
	
	* Player will have limited health to allow some forgiveness
	
	* If the player reaches orbit, they can start a new game with a cumulative score and score multiplier based on the previous game's health

* ### Controls
	
	* WASD to move the rocket on the XY plane on screen
	
	* Going forward (W) is faster than going backward (S)
